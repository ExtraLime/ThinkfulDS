## Drill: Regression or classification
*For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model.*

**1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.**
      Money? Time? Either way regression would be better
    
**2. What color car someone is going to buy.**
      Categorical
    
**3.  How many children a family will have.**
      Either, but depending on the data and the objective of the model

**4. If someone will sign up for a service.**
      Categorical (0/1)

**5. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.**
      I would use Categorical. (you cant get sick...say 3.22343242 times.)

**6. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.**
      Regression

**7. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.**
      Categorical
