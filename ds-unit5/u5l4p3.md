## State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.
   - Popularity of various Uber drivers.
     - No, but collecting the needed data would be difficult.
     - The problem is that people with extreme experiences are more likely to respond
   - A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream.
     - Sure. But it should really just track its sales
   - Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people.
     - Less gay men are likely to respond that question so they would be under represented
   - Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going.
     - No. you would want other information, available inventory, price of gas, ubereffect etc
   - Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 
     - A survey is one way to do this, but not the best way. You would want to A/B test.
   - Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
     - this is a simple regression. however examing effectiveness of nursing could be explored via survey
