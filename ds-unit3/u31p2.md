## DRILL:

#### Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

KNN could be used to examine an indivuals purchases for the month. Using this data and all previous months data, create an outcome variable where 0 is 'customer is not current' and 1 is 'customer is current'. The model would pclassify whether or not a person will be current this month based on their purchases profile.

The parameters (categories of spending) could be normalized to represent the percentage spent on a certain category. This could highlight trends for who pay on time and those who do not.

The parameters could also be weighted based on trends identified in the data. 

You man also want to know the probability of someone defaulting. This could be done with KNN.
