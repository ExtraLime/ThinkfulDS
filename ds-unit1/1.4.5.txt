The Problem:
	“These kids’ grade are just too good, we suspect that there is cheating taking place. Cheating allows students to 
  potentially earn better grades than they deserve and is academically dishonest.”
-Assumptions: a student can only cheat off the student directly to the right or left of themselves. 
(otherwise the teacher is not doing their job)

The Potential Solution:
  A new testing taking method will be administered in an attempt to prevent cheating.  There will be two versions of the test.
  Test A and Test B. The seating assignment will be fixed so that no adjacent rows will have the same test type (the students
  to the left and right of any one student will have a different test type).

We choose a class where we suspect cheating is taking place as the sample and review the scores on prior tests and seating 
position (in the classroom) for the students for the year.

After the tests have been scored, we will measure the class performance on the aggregate. If the mean score decreases by 
15%, we can assume that we have prevented the cheating. If the mean score decreases but by less than a standard deviation, 
we will examine the test scores and seating patterns for individuals over the year for other insight.
